The HTML5 Canvas provides another dimension to web applications, where bitmap animations or other data can be displayed interactively.

\begin{quote}
    ``HTML5 Canvas is an immediate mode bitmapped area of the screen that can be manipulated with JavaScript. Immediate mode refers to the way the canvas renders pixels on the screen. HTML5 Canvas completely redraws the bitmapped screen on every frame by using Canvas API calls from JavaScript.''
