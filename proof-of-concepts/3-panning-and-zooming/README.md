This proof of concept will take some geojson data, and will render it to the display. You will then be able to pan/zoom the view.

The test data file, `data/world-and-ferndown.geojson` is a GeoJSON file, containing buildings in Ferndown, and rough boundaries of world countries.

Run the demo by running `tsc` and then `python -m http.server` in this directory, and visiting [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
