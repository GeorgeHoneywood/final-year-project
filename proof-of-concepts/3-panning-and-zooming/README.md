This proof of concept will take some geojson data, and will render it to the display. You will then be able to pan/zoom the view.

The test data file, `data/world-and-ferndown.geojson` is a GeoJSON file, containing buildings in Ferndown, and rough boundaries of world countries.

Visit https://files.george.honeywood.org.uk/3-panning-and-zooming/ to see the demo online.

To run the demo locally, you will need to install the dependencies. This can be done by writing `pnpm install` or `npm install` in this directory. Once you've done that, you can run `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev`, and visit the URL it gives.
