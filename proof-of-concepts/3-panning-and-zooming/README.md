This proof of concept will take some geojson data, and will render it to the display. You will then be able to pan/zoom the view.

The test data file, `data/ferndown-buildings.geojson` is a GeoJSON file, containing buildings in Ferndown, and a rough boundary of the UK.

Run the demo by writing `python -m http.server` in this directory, and visiting [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
