# Offline HTML5 Proof of Concept

Demo HTML5 app, using the Cache API and the File API to store files for later offline usage.

Service worker example used, from: https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/tree/main/service-worker/simple-service-worker

Run `python3 -m http.server` from this directory, then go to `http://localhost:8000`.
After loading the page once, you should then be able to load it again whilst offline.
