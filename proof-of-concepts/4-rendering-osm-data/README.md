This proof of concept will take some real OpenStreetMap tiled data, and will render it to the display.

Visit https://files.george.honeywood.org.uk/4-rendering-osm-data/ to see the demo online.

To run the demo locally, you will need to install the dependencies. This can be done by writing `pnpm install` or `npm install` in this directory. Once you've done that, you can run `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev`, and visit the URL it gives.

To run the tests, you'll also need to download [dorset-with-debug.map](https://files.george.honeywood.org.uk/2022-11-16-dorset-with-debug.map), put it in the `data/` folder, and rename it to `dorset-with-debug.map`.
