This proof of concept will take some latitude/longitude coordinate pairs, and will render them to the display.

The test data files, `data/*.geojson` are GeoJSON formatted polygons representing the boundaries of towns.

Run the demo by running `tsc` and then `python -m http.server` in this directory, and visiting [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
