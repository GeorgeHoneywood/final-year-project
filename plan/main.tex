\begin{abstract}

In this project I aim to build an offline maps application based on OpenStreetMap data. The user should be able to download map data for their area of interest, then view it by panning and zooming, like a traditional online slippy map. Time permitting, I may also add additional features that require an internet connection, like routing and Wikipedia integration. Through this project I hope to learn about how map data is projected into a rendered map. It will also teach me how to successfully develop a medium-sized application.

\chapter{Aims and objectives}

Here I will list some specific features that I would like to implement in the project. These are not fixed, and some may not be implemented, or others added in their place.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Download vector map data for a user-provided region (preferably at least as large as a UK county), allowing the user to browse the map offline
    \item Allow the user to pan and zoom the map. They should be able to zoom out to the view the full extent of the downloaded data.
    \item Provide a search functionality, using the Nominatim API
    \item Allow the user to route between two points, which could be implemented using OSRM, GraphHopper or Valhalla
    \item When an OSM element has been tagged with a reference to a Wikipedia article, it should show a description from Wikipedia
    \item Allow the user to save and name markers for later use
    \item When online, the application should allow the user to browse a map without having to first download any data. This could be done using raster tiles.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Timeline and milestones}

Following a timeline should help my project to proceed without any major unexpected delays, and will give me targets to aim for. At the beginning of term 1 I will focus on exploring any risky areas or technologies that I am unsure about. This will help any large questions early on in the process.

\section{Deliverables}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Report on offline HTML5 technologies. Will use this to decide whether it is possible to download \& store a large amount of vector map data (>100 MB) for later rendering.\label{item:deliverable:offline-html}
    \item Proof of concept basic offline HTML5 app. Can also use this to discover any limit of how files can be stored for offline use (see~\ref{sec:html5-storage-limits} in Risks \& mitigations).\label{item:deliverable:basic-offline-app}
    \item Report on the different technologies that the program could use to get OpenStreetMap data. One possibility is the Mapsforge format, or it could use the OSM editing API\@. This should help mitigate risk of using a technology that is not suitable for the project (see~\ref{sec:difficult-technologies} in Risks \& mitigations).\label{item:deliverable:osm-data}
    \item Report about how map projection works. Specifically the mathematics behind projecting the Web Mercator data that is produced by OpenStreetMap. This will ensure that I understand this key concept (see~\ref{sec:coordinate-systems} in Risks \& mitigations).\label{item:deliverable:map-projection}
    \item Proof of concept that takes some way made up of latitude longitude pairs and draws a line onto a canvas. If this is too challenging, I could use a library like D3.js, as per~\ref{sec:coordinate-systems} in Risks \& mitagtions.\label{item:deliverable:draw-line}
    \item Make proof of concept~\ref{item:deliverable:draw-line} interactive; allow the user to pan and zoom the map. This should be done with the scroll wheel on desktop and pinch zooming on mobile.\label{item:deliverable:pan-zoom}
    \item Proof of concept that loads some actual OSM data using the technology that I decided upon in deliverable~\ref{item:deliverable:osm-data}. If the implementation proves to be too difficult, I can pivot to another technology that I had explored in deliverable~\ref{item:deliverable:osm-data}.\label{item:deliverable:load-osm-data}
    \item Thoroughly test the application on mobile, as this will likely be the main use case for an offline map.\label{item:deliverable:mobile-testing}
    \item Add online search functionality, using the Nominatim API.\label{item:deliverable:search}
    \item Add online routing functionality, using OSRM, GraphHopper or Valhalla.\label{item:deliverable:routing}
    \item Show point of interest information from Wikipedia, when an OSM element has been tagged to allow this.\label{item:deliverable:wikipedia}
    \item Add the ability to save and name markers for later use.\label{item:deliverable:markers}
    \item Allow the user to browse the map without first downloading data when online. This could be done using raster tiles.\label{item:deliverable:online}
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Risks and mitigations}

Managing risks is an important part of any project, and anticipating and mitigating potential issues should help ensure that the project is successful. In this section I will outline issues that are specific to my project.

\section{HTML5's offline storage limits}\label{sec:html5-storage-limits}

Storing a large amount of map data may not be possible, as the amount of data a single website can store is likely to be limited. If this becomes a problem I will have to explore different technologies, as it could be a major issue for my project if I decide to use a data format that is too large. It will be important to discover this early on, and choose a data format that can work around these possible restrictions.

\section{Difficulty in deciding which technologies to use}\label{sec:difficult-technologies}

At the beginning of the project, I will explore a few different possibilities for how to design the program. For example, I need to explore which source of OSM data would be the best for my application --- traditionally students on this project use the OSM editing API, but it is not very well suited to creating a user-friendly map viewer. I may also look into developing a phone app, as it might help me create a more performant and useful application, rather than making a webapp.

Hence, I must be careful to not spend to long in this evaluation process, as I may get far with one technology, then realize that it has some deficiency that prevents me from using it.

\section{Computational complexity of rendering vector data}

Rendering vector data is a non-trivial task to complete efficiently, especially when there is a large amount of data to render. Additionally, I do not have any experience using the HTML canvas, so I will have to learn how to use it, and how to navigate any performance pitfalls that may be present. Given I want the program to be able to run well on mobile devices that often have limited resources, efficiency is paramount.

To mitigate this I will test my application with reasonable amounts of data, on a mobile device, to ensure that the user experience is acceptable. 

\section{Lack of experience with coordinate systems \& projections}\label{sec:coordinate-systems}

Although I am familiar with the Web Mercator projection that OSM uses to represent coordinates, I have never had to render map data myself. This will require some mathematical equations to translate the coordinates into positions on the canvas, and I will need to learn how to do this. This will likely be a large stumbling block, as I am not a very confident mathematician.

If this proves to be a significant issue, then I could use a library like \href{https://github.com/d3/d3-geo}{D3.js} to help with this aspect of the project. \href{https://openstreetmap.org}{openstreetmap.org}'s online editor, iD, uses this library, so it should be possible to use it in my project if necessary.

\section{Lack of complexity}

If I am to use a map format like Mapsforge, where map data has already been compiled into a format that is easy to render, it may mean that I do not have to implement low level or complex algorithms. This puts the project at risk of being too simplistic.

To mitigate this, I should ensure that I do not rely on external libraries too heavily, and implement as much as is reasonably possible by myself.

\section{Lack of experience with Offline HTML5 web applications}

Offline HTML5 applications are a new technology to me. In the past I have worked on interactive SPAs (single page apps), but these have been traditional ones that work online. Therefore, it is important that I get up to speed with the technologies that allow a web app to work offline.

\section{Poor estimation of timeline}

It is crucial that I adhere to the timeline to ensure that the project is completed smoothly. If I underestimate the amount of time required to complete a task, then I will have to rush to complete it, this could lead to mistakes and poor quality code.

Therefore, I should be careful to assign each task a realistic timeframe, and also allow enough time to write up each section as I proceed through the project.
