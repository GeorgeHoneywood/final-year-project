    <h1>Embedding the application in an iframe</h1>

    <p>This works cross-origin. I might implement some logic to change the UI when the app is being embedded &mdash; like removing the search bar and the open file buttons. These don't really make sense for the use case of embedding a location map into a businesses' website. An option to place a marker on the map would also be useful for this case.</p>
