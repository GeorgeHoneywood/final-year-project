This proof of concept will take some real OpenStreetMap tiled data, and will render it to the display.

Visit https://files.george.honeywood.org.uk/4-rendering-osm-data/ to see the demo online. This demo should also work offline, using a Service Worker. Once you have visited the page once whilst online, it should be stored in the Service Worker cache, and further offline visits should be possible.

To run the demo locally, you will need to install the dependencies. This can be done by writing `pnpm install` or `npm install` in this directory. Once you've done that, you can run `pnpm dev` or `npm run dev`, and visit the URL it gives.

To run the tests, you'll also need to download [dorset-with-debug.map](https://files.george.honeywood.org.uk/2022-11-16-dorset-with-debug.map), put it in the `data/` folder, and rename it to `dorset-with-debug.map`.
