\begin{abstract}

    Although web maps are commonplace, offline maps are a valuable niche that are useful in certain situations, such as on mobile devices with limited data, or when roaming abroad.
    
    In this project I aim to build an offline maps application based on OpenStreetMap data. The user should be able to download map data for their area of interest, then view it by panning and zooming, like a traditional online slippy map. Time permitting, I may also add additional features that require an internet connection, like routing and Wikipedia integration. Through this project I hope to learn about how map data is projected into a rendered map. It will also teach me how to successfully develop a medium-sized application.
