# Final Year Project Diary

## Term 1

### Week 2 (2022-09-26)

Worked on the initial project plan. Read through "OpenStreetMap -- Using and Enhancing the Free Map of the World".

### Week 3 (2022-10-03)

Got feedback on initial plan from my supervisor (Reuben Rowe), and made alterations based on it. Specifically, I shorted the abstract by moving content to an introduction section, wrote a general "Aims & objectives" section, and added a "Deliverables" section, referencing these deliverables in the timeline. I also polished the "Risks & mitigations" section, and changed inline links to references.

### Week 4 (2022-10-10)

Worked on the first report, about offline HTML5 applications (deliverable 1).

### Week 5 (2022-10-17)

Worked on the offline HTML5 proof of concept (deliverable 2). Implemented a demo offline app using service workers, with the ability to load a large file either from the local disk using the File API, or from the service worker cache with the Cache API.
